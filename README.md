### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Project title: General feelings towards the president and economic struggles during current presidency
+ This project is conducted by Jaival Desai

+ Project summary: It seems minorities prefer voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump.
There is a strong belief among voters that the president does not have the necessary qualities needed to be a good leader. Voters strongly believe that Donald Trump has done a poor job handling the economy during his tenure, especially during the current pandemic. They also strongly condemn the immigration policies and the way he has handled foreign affairs.
